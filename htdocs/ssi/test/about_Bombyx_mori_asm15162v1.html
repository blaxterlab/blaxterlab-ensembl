  <p id="about">The silkworm, <em>Bombyx mori</em>, has been used for silk production for over 5,000 years, and continues to be an economically important species. <em>B. mori</em> is a fully domesticated insect, and due to its ease of culture, the silkworm has become a model organism in the study of lepidopteran and arthropod biology [1,2].</p>

  <h2 id="assembly" style="margin-bottom:5px">Assembly</h2>
  <p>The <em>Bombyx mori</em> genome was assembled by the International Silkworm Genome Sequencing Consortium, a joint collaboration of the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (NIAS) in Japan and the Southwest University in Chongqing City, China. The consortium integrated two early assemblies into a single high-quality assembly with ~10x coverage of the genome [3]. Approximately 87% of the scaffolds are assembled into 28 linkage groups; this is not represented in Ensembl Metazoa, but is available at <a href="http://sgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/KAIKObase">KAIKObase</a> [4]. In release 22 of Ensembl Metazoa (March 2014) the assembly was updated to remove contigs (primarily bacterial contaminants and duplicate regions) that were not part of the canonical INSDC record.</p>
  <p>There are two sets of scaffold names in use for <em>Bombyx mori</em>. The INSDC records have scaffold names like "<em>:_Bm_scaf586_strain:_p50T_Dazao.</em>", but these have been abbreviated in Ensembl Metazoa (from release 22 onwards), to "<em>scaf586</em>", for example. (The longer INSDC nomenclature is listed as a synonym, however, so searches and uploads using that format should still go to the right place.) These scaffold numbers are also used by KAIKObase. Earlier Ensembl Metazoa releases used the nomenclature from SilkDB, which is formatted like "<em>nscaf29</em>"; note that the numbers in these names do not correpond to those in the INSDC names. The <a href="/tools.html">assembly converter tool</a> maps between our current assembly ("GCA_000151625.1") and the earlier version ("Bmor1").</p>
  <p>In adding <em>Bombyx mori</em> to LepBase we have also included NCBI scaffold names as synonyms, to allow searches for these names as well.</p>

  <p>Lepbase has imported the genome and gene model information available at <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF_000151625.1_ASM15162v1">NCBI's ftp server</a>. The gene models in Lepbase correspond to the GFF provided at the NCBI site. However, only 16936 protein aa sequences in Lepbase are identical to the 19559 protein aa sequences in the NCBI protein aa file. All the differences are caused by inconsistencies between the NCBI GFF file and their protein file. NCBI documents these differences in their GFF, but because we use only the NCBI GFF to import gene modesl and compute protein aa sequences, our protein sequences are different.</p>
  <p>The other <a href="/Bombyx_mori"><em>Bombyx mori</em></a> page on this site uses the same assembly but uses the annotations from SilkDB [5]</p>
