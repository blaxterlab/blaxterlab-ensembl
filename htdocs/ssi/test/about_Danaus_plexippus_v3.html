  <p id="about">Each autumn millions of the migratory Monarch Butterfly, Danaus plexippus, undergo a long-distance migration of up to 4,000 km from eastern North America to their wintering grounds in central Mexico. During this migration, the Monarch uses a time-compensated sun compass to allow them to maintain a southerly direction. In addition to the great opportunities for studying circadian clockwork and the molecular basis of long-distance migration, the mimicry complex formed by the Monarch and the Viceroy butterflies offers insights into adaptive evolution.</p>

  <p>The genome assembly was obtained from <a href="http://monarchbase.umassmed.edu/genome.html">MonarchBase</a>. "The latest monarch genome assembly (v3) includes 5,397 scaffolds spanning 249 Mb. The N50 size of the v3 assembly is 715 Kb, and the N90 size is 160 Kb. Ninety percent of the monarch assembly is now represented by 366 of the longest scaffolds".</p>
